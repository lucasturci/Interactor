# Interactor

A program to test solutions of interactive problems.

## How to use

First install the binary by running `make install`.

Now, write a solution program and a program to simulate the judge (i.e., a program that reads the queries of your solution from stdin and responds to stdout). Then, compile than to their executables (let's call them `solution` and `judge`), and then run `interactor solution judge`.

Check the examples to see how they work.
